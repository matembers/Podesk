We never talk about mundane topics like sports or weather, we always go to higher planes of love and consciousness as we do in today's episode that was recorded on a pleasant late Spring evening while we sat outside on Duncan's front porch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In this conversation we talk about spirituality, the transformation of evil souls into good ones, neurological science and most bend bending of all is his theory that we are all unknowingly building a time machine for the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He has his own podcast that I have appeared on twice called the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. I like how when we get together it is mental ping pong hitting ideas back and forth. When we get together it is wise to roll recording equipment and if the universe was balanced correctly he and I would already have a TV show together.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Aside from having a brilliant mind he also very easily always cracks me up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Duncan Trussell.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/duncan-trussell","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Duncan_Trussell_mixdown.mp3","duration":"02:19:16"},{"title":"Ted Alexandro","pubDate":1400695238,"pubDateFR":"21 Mai 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Minneapolis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In the future if we are lucky every comedian will be more like Ted Alexandro.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Not only funny but passionate about knowledge and politically active.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I am a fan of Ted Alexandro because whenever I see him perform he is talking about things that matter and putting his unique opinion on world events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He is the kind of comedian I like the most in that he is the kind of comedian you learn things from, one that makes you see a topic from a different way you hadn't seen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He studied music and taught music before becoming a comedian and teaching seems to infuse most every act that he commits artistically.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He will forever be enshrined in the comedy history books for starting the movement that led to the New York City comedy clubs to raise the pay for comedians from the paltry 20 dollars a set they had paid for years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Ted was heavily involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement from the beginning and it is not only a driving force in his life it reflects creatively in his comedy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He has a web series called Teacher's Lounge that stars many greats of American comedy. Ted is universally loved and respected. He is an exciting performer because anything could happen to him, be it film, television or the mind welding of our video future. I think he and his family should be studied scientifically so that more people can turn out just like him.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you the one &amp; only Ted Alexandro.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/ted-alexandro","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Ted_Alexandro_mixdown.mp3","duration":"01:18:06"},{"title":"Jackie Kashian","pubDate":1399686705,"pubDateFR":"10 Mai 2014","description":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">Jackie Kashian is a powerhouse comedian by any way you measure it.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">She has a strong sense of humor and slices up topics of mundane living and her own personal rage with ease. Her autobiographical humor has been seen on Comedy Central and countless late night talk shows. She has a popular podcast called 'Dork Forrest' where people talk about their strange obsessions. When I did it we talked about my obsession of going to graves of people I admire. She is perhaps the most requested guest I have had from my listeners asking me to get her on my show.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I love her honesty, her work ethic and no matter what form of entertainment she is presenting she always makes me laugh.

He has been referred to as the Persian Elvis. He has appeared in countless film and television roles but my favorite incarnation of him is as a stand up comedian.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I am a fan of his comedy because it contains the original energy of joy. His brand of comedy is not the slumped shoulders, down on your luck kind. His is a man in love with life and clearly enjoying himself onstage and that is what it is all about. In comedy, just like in real life it's all about having fun and enjoying yourself.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I also admire Maz's work ethic. When I am in Los Angeles I always run into him around town doing sets and working on new material. This conversation was recorded in his home where I met his beautiful wife and amazing children. In every form of media these days the negative gets high lighted and too much time is spent glorifying bitter turds. The fact that he is the complete opposite of an unhappy human is why I love him so much.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the bright ball of sunshine that is Maz Jobrani!&nbsp;<\/div>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/maz-jobrani","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Maz_Jobrani_Final.mp3","duration":"01:28:25"},{"title":"Joseph Wilson","pubDate":1397774436,"pubDateFR":"18 Avril 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in London.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first met Joseph Wilson when I performed at the Comedy Cafe in London in 2013.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">We hit if off instantly and unbeknownst to me he became a avid listener of my podcast. I found out he was listening to my podcast 6 months later when he was on vacation in Peru and sent me a video he filmed at the top of Machu Pichu where he recreated and slightly mocked the opening of my podcast where I list all the fabulous places in the world I am going to take the listener. I thought the video was funny and I was very flattered he filmed it in my honor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This year when I got to London I got to hang out with Joseph a lot and get to know him better and today consider him a good friend. He is well dressed, has a theatrical personality, is an animated story teller and he is fun to be around. He currently holds the distinction of being the only comedian to appear on my podcast whose act I have not seen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Even though I have stopped drinking I had a great time going out in London with him and discovering new watering holes in the Soho district that he took me to. For me personally any British person who wears top quality embroidered cowboy shirts with sincerity is a diamond geezer in my book.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">There are many reasons to love Joseph Wilson, first and foremost is the ease and comfort he can blast out hard core funny in a laid back conversation.

My guest today is Don Ward, the owner of the Comedy Store.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Since its opening in 1979 it has single handedly changed the British comedy scene from tired old pub comedians doing Mother in law jokes to the champions league of powerful original comedy that it is today. It is now an established institution of British comedy because every British comedy legend of the past 30 years has performed there. Don Ward is the visionary who made this work and who has witnessed the development and rise of these now household names, French &amp; Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous), Eddie Izzard, Ben Elton, Jimmy Carr, Harry Hill and on and on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The first time I ever did a set at the Comedy Store was in 1994. Then again in 1998 which led to me playing there regularly in 1999. In 2000 the Comedy Store started managing me for Europe while I lived in Amsterdam. You could say I had life by the balls back then and I was most certainly spoiled by being under the loving umbrella of the Comedy Store. Don Ward always treated me like a king and I always enjoyed speaking with him about comedy. I love and respect the man dearly. I love him like a relative in fact. Then I fucked up....<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I've been working on writing a book the past few years and I will go into more details there because in the story of my life Don Ward and the Comedy Store is an important chapter. The truth of the matter was that I was partying too much in London after shows and I frightened myself enough to decided to take a break on the place for a while when I moved back to the US in 2004.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I should have communicated with Don better about what was going on in my life. I owed him that. I owed him the respect her deserves so I wish I had been more honest with him. Needless to say feelings got hurt and it took me many years to mop up the mess that I had made.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I missed London and all my friends there so I just started going back a few years ago. One of my main reasons to go back was to set things right with Don Ward and apologize to him for me being such a schmuck. Last year when I was in London I went into Don's office and had the heart to heart talk with him. I told him since my Dad and my sister died I now see that the most important thing in life is the relationships you have with people. I told him how important he is to me, how I appreciated him treating me like a king and that I was ashamed and sorry over how I had disappeared on him. He could have rightfully told me to fuck off. Thankfully he welcomed me back to the Comedy Store and told me how that is all water under the bridge now.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode is very important to me because it was recorded between shows on Saturday February 22, 2014, the first weekend I have performed there in ten years. This episode is the end of a circle that took me ten years to get around to the other side of because of my mistake.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Never turn your back on the people who give you love and respect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Don Ward is a living legend in the world of comedy because he has seen it all and presented the greatest comedians the world has every known. One day the British government will put a historical marker in front of the Comedy Store but until then we have the wealth of knowledge living in the museum of Don's mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode is very important to me because it is with someone I love and respect and that was crucial to my development as a world wide performer. It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Don Ward.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/don-ward","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Don_Ward_mixdown.mp3","duration":"01:47:32"},{"title":"Natalia Tena","pubDate":1396414212,"pubDateFR":"02 Avril 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in London.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Within the first 5 minutes I met Natalia Tena she was cracking me up and I was teaching her the basic steps of the tango.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I think she is a feminist icon badass woman. She is an amazing actress whose first role was in the Hugh Grant film 'About A Boy'. Since then she has had a sterling career staring in the Harry Potter films and in Game Of Thrones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Most human beings would die content with those credits but not Natalia Tena!<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She is also the lead singer and creative driving force of the band Molotov Jukebox which just released their new album 'Carnival Flower'.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Her parents are from Spain so rhythm is naturally in her DNA, she told me that her aim is for people to go home and make love after her concerts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Molotov Jukebox has performed all over the world inciting raucous ass wiggling good fun in it's path.

Her acting career continues to excite and she stars in the new independent film '10,000 KM' that is currently winning awards at film festivals all over the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Her accomplishments are a part of the pinnacles of modern entertainment but she is one of the most down to earth people you could meet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">As a strong powerful woman she indisputably kicks truck loads of ass but most important to me is that she is wildly hilarious and hanging out with her is like hanging out with a comedian.

She was a fun and easy interviewer and I liked that she could roll with my answers injecting her wit into the conversation effortlessly. &nbsp;She is the editor and primary journalist for art and culture happenings in Paris. I thought she would be an interesting guest because she knows everything that is happening for art and entertainment in Paris and also because she is usually the one answering the questions. I have stayed in touch with her in the past year and a half and I have enjoyed seeing the clips she has posted of her interviews with artists, musicians and movie stars that have graced her studio. Her journalistic path that led to her current reign at France 24 is an interesting tale and once a year she gets to hit the red carpet to interview all of the film industry people in attendance at the Cannes film festival.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I owe a great deal of respect and gratitude to Eve because of a huge blunder on my part that happened during this recording. She told me about how last year at Cannes she interviewed Woody Allen about his latest film 'Blue Jasmine' and when they got back to the editing studio they realized that her sound man had forgot to hit the record button. I thought to myself \"What a boob! Who could screw something up that was that important.\" Then after an hour of conversation my computer went black because it had run out of energy and the entire recording was lost. My computer said it had 18% left but it went black nonetheless and I was rightfully embarrassed and deflated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The ever gracious Eve told me not to worry and come back later that night at 8pm to record it again. This is recording number 2 that we did later that night. It cost me 40 Euros each way from my hotel to her home 4 times, 160 Euros total. This is probably the most expensive episode I have ever created but it was worth every Euro cent because I think Eve is that interesting, fun and knowledgable.&nbsp; It is my secret desire to make some type of entertainment talk show with her to be broadcast from Paris to the rest of the English speaking world. Aside from being a magnanimous charismatic human being, she is the kind of generous soul who would give a boob like me a second chance to record with her after screwing up monumentally. She is has an effervescent soul and knows everything there is to know about art, culture and entertainment in Paris today. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Eve Jackson.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/eve-jackson","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Presents_Eve_Jackson.mp3","duration":"01:22:11"},{"title":"Sebastian Marx","pubDate":1394080779,"pubDateFR":"06 Mars 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Paris.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I met Sebastian Marx the last time I played in Paris.&nbsp;He has the young hot new scene &nbsp;putting on stand up comedy nights in English and in French.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">When I met him I came to see him perform a one hour show in French.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He has lived in France for years and speaks French fluently. I didn't understand a word of the show but I was impressed to see an American speaking French and getting laughs. He is originally from New York with Argentinian parents. There are many reasons for me to love Sebastian Marx because he and I have so many things in common. Being American with a parental Argentinian connection, love of comedy, love of French culture, not afraid to live in Europe, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">The upstairs room at the So Gymnase theatre is where I did my shows with Sebastian. It's an intimate cozy room with old couches and a low ceiling which is perfect for comedy. He regularly puts on his New York Comedy Nights show there. The audiences I experienced where multiethnic, multinational and of higher intellect. Also there were lots of French comedians hanging out and making the scene.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Comedy is a brotherhood in many ways because not many people know what it is like to face the fire, to get shit on your face if need be, with the quit respect of fighter pilots. Hanging out with comedians is one of my favorite things in life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I like what Sebastian Marx is doing in Paris. There is a young hot eager scene there and if you are traveling to Paris and want to do some shows he is the man to know. It's a small room, not a big money maker but worth it in measure of fun and getting your performance orgasm. Sebastian is not only super lovable on stage he is the same sweet guy off the stage too. I had fun running around Paris with him in the communal electric cars of Paris. All over the city there are batches of small electric cars that can be picked up and dropped off using an iPhone app to set it all up. It's cheaper and easier than taking a taxi and being a French citizen he uses that electric car like a master. Enjoying Paris is always best when you experience it with a resident who knows how to get around.&nbsp;Sebastian set up my Paris shows, promoted them and hosted them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;\">On my show February 4, 2014 which happened to be my 30th anniversary he baked me a cake and has 30 candles on it that he brought out to me at the end of my show. The entire audience sang to me and it was a golden memory of an evening. I think he is funny, smart and lovable and it is my pleasure to present to you the one and only Sebastian Marx.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/sebastian-marx","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Presents_Sebastian_Marx.mp3","duration":"01:14:11"},{"title":"Sand van Roy","pubDate":1393541760,"pubDateFR":"27 F\u00e9vrier 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Paris.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first met Sand Van Roy after my show in Paris in June 2012. Speaking with her I was tickled to find out that she was a huge comedy fan and that he all time favorite comedian is Mitch Hedberg. She was thrilled to hear that I was Mitch Hedberg's friend. She was trying a joke that she had written out on me and I told her that I liked it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In this conversation recorded earlier this month in Paris I discover that it was that moment that inspired Sand to begin being a comedian one week after I met her. Because of Mitch Hedberg's influence on her she has a style of comedy that is exclusively one liners. What I consider to be the hardest form of comedy that requires a sharp mind and expert precision.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Sand is from Holland and now lives in Paris earning her living as a model. She is the first ever super model comedian that I am aware of. To focus on her good looks instead of her comedy is to sell her short in appreciating her outer shell instead of her brain power to invent sharply funny thoughts and observations. In this episode she tells me about the current comedy scene in Paris that happens in English and French.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded on February 4, 2014, my 30th anniversary of being a comedian. We recorded this just a few hours before my anniversary show which Sand opened up for me on. Aside from talking about comedy she gives me all the insight and juicy trash that goes on in the modeling world. I think she is smart, funny and destined for greatness in the world of comedy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Sand Van Roy.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/sand-van-roy","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Radio_Presents_Sand_van_Roy.mp3","duration":"01:19:34"},{"title":"Peter Klashorst","pubDate":1392822420,"pubDateFR":"19 F\u00e9vrier 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Amsterdam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I first met Peter Klashorst ten years ago when he appeared as a guest on my Amsterdam late night talk show. At the time I was told that he was famous for painting naked black women. Having a deep appreciation for dark skinned women I liked the man instantly. His journey as an artist has been epic with a world wide reach.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He lived in Senegal where he was arrested for running a brothel. He said he was only hiring women as models but the authorities wanted to hassle him. From there he moved to Kenya and his feelings about Africa and African people are dear to his heart and he still maintains an art studio there as well as in Amsterdam.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I got to hang out with Peter several times in Amsterdam and he is one of the few humans alive who earns his living solely from painting works of art. Every fiber of his being exudes the thoughts and actions of an artist and it was a joy to see him painting in his studio when I did. As a younger man I always loved Rembrandt and Van Gogh but this is a true living great artist and it is possible that Peter Klashorst is currently the greatest living Dutch artist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He is now living in Cambodia working on one of the most heart felt acts of his career. For several years he has been painting the portraits of the victims of Pol Pot's genocide against his own people from the photos that were taken of them just before they were executed. Like most great artists Peter doesn't commit himself to anything unless his heart is fully in it and it seems that Cambodia has captured his heart and he will continue to do great work there. He is very open about fucking prostitutes and trouble he has received from living his life passionately as an artist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This conversation was recorded 4 years ago late at night when Peter and I were drinking multiple beers. This is actually one of the first interviews I did for Tom Rhodes Radio. We talked and recorded for 4 hours and this episode was taken from the first 2 hours before the beverages really kicked in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I respect Peter Klashorst as a man, as an artist, as a true friend and it would be hard to find anyone who is living their dream of being a true artist with a real powerful vision than him. As he says in this conversation \"I want to show how beautiful God created this earth and all of it's inhabitants.\" I believe that the life and art of his will live on forever because it is timeless. It was made from his pure vision of love and beauty. Aside from his superior art and world encompassing philosophy I think he is very funny.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Mr. Peter Klashorst.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/peter-klashorst","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Presents_Peter_Klashorst.mp3","duration":"01:50:57"},{"title":"Zihni \u00d6zdil","pubDate":1392300473,"pubDateFR":"13 F\u00e9vrier 2014","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This episode was recorded in Rotterdam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It always tickles me to meet intelligent people who attend my shows and are fans of mine.

He is currently about to finish filming a series for Dutch television that he created where he takes Dutch comedians of ethnic immigrant backgrounds back to their mother countries to see how that influences them as comedians.

He is a prime example of the great and powerful things that can happen if you follow your heart and do what you believe in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">It is my pleasure to present to you the one and only Mr. Drew Hastings.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/drew-hastings","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Presents_Drew_Hastings.mp3","duration":"01:41:05"},{"title":"Lizz Winstead","pubDate":1387391700,"pubDateFR":"18 D\u00e9cembre 2013","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This episode was recorded in Brooklyn, New York.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Having co-created the Daily Show and co-founded Air America it is a solid fact that Lizz Winstead has left a permanent mark on American entertainment and the American consciousness. Like most innovators and socially forward thinkers the roots of her tree began in stand up comedy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I worked with Lizz several times in the early years of my career as her opening act. I was a very young and inexperienced comedian and I loved and respected her from our initial meeting. She was a strong female headliner in a profession that was mostly male dominated. She shared her comedy wisdom with me back then and I have always appreciated the intelligence she brought to any project she put her name on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In the early years of Comedy Central I appeared on the first version of the Daily Show that Lizz was one of the producers of. I felt like a proud relative seeing Lizz kicking ass in the television world just as hard as she had as a headliner in the stand up comedy world. It had been many years since I had seen her and both of our lives and careers have taken many twists and turns since then.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Today, Lizz can be seen on countless political talk shows commenting on American politics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I believe it is no easy task for a comedian to move into political activism and stay funny as well as socially relevant but Lizz has done this supremely. Her current passion is defending the reproductive rights of women from law makers who wish to infringe upon this right.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">In this episode she refers to herself as a vagina warrior, which makes me smile even as I type the words.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I was excited to see my old friend who I respect greatly. I arrived in Brooklyn on the subway and stepped out into a cold down pour of December rain. At her home I was delighted to find she had just had delivered my favorite pizza, prosciutto and fresh arugula. This woman is magic. Right before we started recording she let me smoke at her window which broke and remained half open with the cold air streaming in. I was thrilled to take a ride through her opinions and thoughts on a wide range of topics and I was secretly pleased she was not angered that I had broken her window. She is someone I have always respected and been cheering for from afar.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">She is the one and only comedy crusader that is Lizz Winstead.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/lizz-winstead","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Presents__Lizz_Winstead.mp3","duration":"01:12:32"},{"title":"Jim Gaffigan","pubDate":1386795988,"pubDateFR":"11 D\u00e9cembre 2013","description":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">This episode was recorded in New York City.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I was in New York last week to film the new Dave Attell series for Comedy Central. At the moment it is called 'Adults Only'. It's an uncensored stand up show that will air sometime next year. I was there the entire week and got to watch every taping.

It was also great to see a few friends that I had not seen in many years. One of my favorite things in the world is to get together with comedians I love and admire and talk about comedy experiences and the nuts and bolts of the business.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">One of those people is Jim Gaffigan.

When Jerry Rocha featured for me at the Atlanta Punchline I was pleased at how hard he rocked the room, warming the audience up rather than fouling up the bath water for the rest of the bathers. On and off stage Jerry is extremely likable. I like his style on stage and that he is not too cool to embrace his silliness. I think that after a few more years of seasoning he'll be a beast on the circuit and on viewing screens that must be dealt with. I love the material he does now and I look forward to seeing what mind bending humorous thoughts he comes up with in the future.

She decided to stay based in Seattle to be with her family and I think she is better off for it. Her real life experiences are the gems of her material that makes me laugh the hardest but it is her inventiveness in her style and in her songs that make her a comedy legend. She has been a true friend to me and it would be impossible for me to come to Seattle and not see her. Cathy is one of those rare creatures who personally busts me up with laughter.

He is from Chicago but about to move to New York. It was such a busy week for both of us the only time we had to record was during our breaks on a 3 show Saturday. The result is some good examination of the shows and the crowds. Smart comedy has always come out of Chicago and Drew is a prime example of this.

I couldn't believe it when I saw it but here was my friend standing there performing to a room full of Chinese people getting laughs in Chinese! I was absolutely blown away by this feat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;\">In this episode we talk about Des' television highlights in Ireland and how he came to fall in love with China to make a life here.

When I was 17 I went to see Sam Kinison in Orlando and Carl LaBove was the opening act. Carl blew me away that night with his ferocious comedy cyclone, Kinison was wasted and I left the Bob Carr auditorium thinking Carl LaBove was a name to remember. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">Years later I met Carl when we did the Toronto comedy festival together.

He is the perfect example to shatter the notion that comedy is a young man's game.

He wasn't playing in comedy clubs then he had a regular Wednesday night stint at a bar in Lower Manhattan. A musician friend of mine took me to see him and the musician friend told me \"This guy does more than comedy. He does raw naked truth\". I was ready to not like it but what happened over the next two hours as I sat watching him in this dark bar was uniquely powerful. It took him about 20 minutes to warm up but once he did there were slabs of brilliance. He spoke so freely and candidly about being a heroin addict and male prostitute I was transfixed. The sheer raw power of his honestly as he portrayed different stories of his personal history made me a fan of his work and the comedy thunderbolts he was throwing down.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I didn't meet Rick until about 7 or 8 years ago at a party of comedians in Los Angeles. I must have ignored everyone for most of the night because my main memory of that party is of talking with Rick all night about comedy in the back yard. Sometimes you need to be patient with Rick, just like that first time I saw him in New York, because once he gets warms up it is truly masterful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">This conversation was recorded at Rick's Hollywood bungalow. In this chat a beautiful point is made in that comedy wasn't invented for the young and beautiful. It was invented for the damaged people, the ones with great stories to tell. Few people have lived the life that Rick Shapiro has and I admire him because he weaves his stories throughout his brilliant observations on modern living.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">He's not afraid to get angry and yell at the injustice's of the world. I like his vulnerability and his sincerity on and off the stage. I think that sincerity is the bravest choice a comedian could make and Rick is a perfect example of this style.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I respect this man and believe him to be an American comedy legend who will be remembered and studied. Precisely for the very reason how he was first described to me, for his raw naked truth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I'm proud to present to you here and now the raw naked truth of Rick Shapiro.<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/rick-shapiro","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Tom_Rhodes_Radio_Presents_Rick_Shapiro.mp3","duration":"01:20:05"},{"title":"Sananda Maitreya","pubDate":1381369260,"pubDateFR":"10 Octobre 2013","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">I believe this episode is among the very best that I have yet been a part of because of the time, love and preparation that went into making it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Sananda Maitreya was once known by a former name that I will not speak because I get the feeling that person no longer exists and that is the way Mr. Maitreya wants it. I love and respect this man so much it is effortless for me to comply with his wishes. Earlier this year I discovered his brand new album entitled 'Return to Zooathalon' and it has been in my heavy rotation in the music that I have been using to pump me up and fuel me up to keep motoring down the highway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">For me as a music lover there is no better feeling than when you fall in love with an artist's music to discover that they have an entire body of work that you were unaware of. That is what happened with me after I feel in love with 'Return to Zooathalon', I discovered the period of recordings Mr. Maitreya calls Post Millennium &nbsp;Rock. There are so many smash hits in these recordings! As I got further into his music I went deeper into exploring his website <span style=\"color: #4787ff;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/sanandamaitreya.com\/\">sanandamaitreya.com<\/a>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&amp;<\/span><\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/sananda.org\/\"><span style=\"color: #4787ff;\">sananda.org<\/span><\/a> where I discovered his archive or writings. His writings reminded me of my own comedy notebooks that I have been keeping for years and made me fall deeper in love with the man behind the music.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Mr. Maitreya lives in Milan, Italy with his wife who he loves and inspires him and they have just had their second child. I keep referring to him as Mr. Maitreya because many years ago I was lucky enough to be the opening act for James Brown and Ray Charles. Backstage everyone addressed them as Mr. Brown or Mr. Charles. Even Ray Charles' son Ray Charles Jr. called him Mr. Charles! I believe this is the same respect that Mr. Maitreya commands. In this conversation when Mr. Maitreya refers to an artist that he respects and admires I like that calls them master.

I was shocked and saddened to learn that Dara Faizi died on September 30, 2013 at the tender young age of 25.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">I became friends with Dara when he was first starting out as a comedian in Holland.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">He was a young master of comedy even when he just started. He had confidence as a story teller and a command of the stage you don't normally see in a comedian who is just starting out. He told fierce tales about being from Afghanistan and how his father was killed by the Taliban. He was an only child brought to Holland by his Mother when he was only 9 years old.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">On long van rides to do theater shows all over Holland he would pick my brain with questions about being a comedian and performing. There are times as a comedian when you see a young performer and you know that they are destined for great things. That is how I felt about Dara, I knew he was going to be a star from the moment I met him.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">This conversation was recorded on November 1, 2010 in Amsterdam. For years before I started doing my podcast I had been filming comedians for the comedy travel TV show idea that I have about highlighting comedians around the world. Dara Faiza was one of the comedians I wanted to highlight from Holland. Originally I was only going to use a few clips from this conversation for the TV show I wanted to make but since that show is still not in the works and Dara has passed on I see no reason to keep this chat to myself.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">Since we recorded this conversation his career path had been smart, going in the Dutch tradition of cabaret where you craft hour theater performances instead of a night club act. In recent years he was doing lots of Dutch television programs and being highlighted deservedly so in the Dutch media. His story is epic and he lays it all out for me here.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">My heart aches to think of his Mother and how shattered she must be right now. In truth everyone's heart should ache because the world of comedy and performance lost a great talent. I still can't believe that he is no longer of this earth but I am grateful that I recorded this conversation with him when he was only 22.<\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;\">I am proud that he was my friend and I'm pleased to present to you here the bright light that is Dara Faizi!<\/div>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/dara-faizi","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Dara_Faizi_.mp3","duration":"01:03:55"},{"title":"Jim Breuer","pubDate":1380158100,"pubDateFR":"26 Septembre 2013","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Verdana;\">I've known Jim Breuer since we were both starting out in Florida back at Ron Bennington's Comedy Scene in Clearwater.

I was looking forward to seeing him and telling him how much I loved his act the last few times I had seen him because he bravely spoke about taking care of Dad and helping him through his illness. It was the most heartbreaking subject matter turned into hilarious comedy. It turned out Jim has just released a film about his father's illness called 'More than me' which is now available on Netflix. In this conversation he opens up about his Dad, the highs and frustrations of being a main player on SNL, the greatest show business advice he ever received from Bill Cosby, hilarious opinions and stories that solidify Jim as one of the most head strong people in comedy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Verdana;\">His podcast model entertainment empire development concept is brilliant and I have always enjoyed seeing what projects he comes out with next.

I have performed in every town that ends in ville or boro. &nbsp; I did a horrendous gig in Mobile, Alabama many years ago and the best thing about it was I made a life long friendship with Faye Woodruff. &nbsp; Faye is a southern comedy legend known as the Grand Mother From Hell. She started doing the road once her husband Joe had retired and they would travel together. It was inspiring to see an older couple who were still head over heels in love with each other. Sadly, Joe passed away and as she gets older Faye does the road less and less. She has been an important person in my life. My Grand Mother died when I was very young and I have always considered Faye to be a sort of Grand Mother figure to me. She loves dirty jokes and that is why she is called the Grand Mother from Hell because she looks like a sweet little old lady when she takes the stage but then her act that follows is filthy and hilarious. She once robbed a comedy club at gun point in Jacksonville Beach, FL after they refused to pay her. She tells that story here and how she made the most fun out of her time in jail. I also get her to tell me my favorite story of hers which is what she taught a parrot to say in Key West, FL. She loves Nashville, country music and filthy jokes. I go out of my way to swing by Nashville to visit her whenever I have the chance. Things haven't been easy since Joe died but she loves life and believes in laughter and jokes to be the sweetest joys a person could know. Once you hear this conversation, recorded in Nashville last year, you will know why I have loved her since the day I met her and why she is called the Grand Mother from Hell.&nbsp;<\/p>","link":"http:\/\/trr.libsyn.com\/faye-woodruff","url":"http:\/\/www.podtrac.com\/pts\/redirect.mp3\/traffic.libsyn.com\/trr\/Faye_Woodruff_Edited_2.mp3","duration":"56:57"},{"title":"Kuah Jenhan","pubDate":1378469857,"pubDateFR":"06 Septembre 2013","description":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Tom Rhodes Radio is in Malaysia!<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;\">Kuah Jenhan is the darling of the Malaysian comedy scene.
