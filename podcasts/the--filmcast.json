As I\u2019ve said, that means only films released from May 3rd 2013 to the Labor Day weekend, counting only the money those films make domestically (US and Canada) in that period. In other words films from March or April might still be making money after May 3st, but they don\u2019t count; films released from May on could start racking up foreign B.O., but that doesn\u2019t count; films released from May on could still be making money into September, but that doesn\u2019t count either. Box Office numbers are generally available late Monday or Tuesday after the weekend closes. For the last seven or so years, I have been using box office numbers from Yahoo Box Office which gets their numbers in turn from Box Office Mojo. So what you will be doing is figuring out what 10 films will make the most money, and putting them in order of what you think they will gross at the box office. BUT, in addition to your top 10, you get to pick 3 \u201cDark Horses\u201d- films you think *might* make it, but that you are not confident enough about to put into the top 10 proper.<br \/>\nThe Scoring:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGetting number 1 or number 10 dead-on gets you 13 points (each).<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe rest of the scoring goes like this:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n10 points for numbers 2-9 dead-on<br \/>\n7 points if your pick was only one spot away from where it ended up<br \/>\n5 points if it was two spots away<br \/>\n3 points if your pick is anywhere in the Top 10<br \/>\n1 point for each dark horse that makes it into the Top 10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe scoring is tabulated so that you get the SINGLE HIGHEST point value for each pick- that is, if you get number ten right, you don\u2019t get 13+3, you only get 13.<br \/>\nAt the end of the summer, the three of us will hop back on the \/Filmcast and make fun of each other as well as crown the 2013 Summer Box Office Champion.
