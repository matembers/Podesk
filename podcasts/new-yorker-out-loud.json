Here, Levy speaks with Sasha Weiss about her piece and her interests as a writer. Levy has written about several female athletes, including the runner Caster Semenya and the boxer Claressa Shields, but says she's not really a sports fan. \"Female athletes interest me because what you're talking about is strength and power,\" Levy says. \"And that takes a certain amount of chutzpah to be female and say, 'I'm going to cultivate strength and speed and power and physical prowess.' So, from a sort of feminist point of view, that excites me.\" Levy has written about a range of subjects, including fashion, radical lesbian separatists, exotic cat breeding, and Silvio Berlusconi. Weiss asks if she sees herself as having a particular beat, and Levy says that, to some extent, she writes about gender and sexuality, but that that's only a starting point. A good story also needs a strong dramatic arc, Levy says, as well as a counterintuitive element, something that you don't see coming. \"The trick is to find those things with a great story,\" she says. \"It's no good, just, 'I'm going to go for a wallow in the sex and gender mud.' If there's no weird, crazy story, then it's just mud.\" Levy and Weiss also talk about how she finds the crucial twists in her stories, and about her recent personal account in the magazine about having a miscarriage while on a reporting assignment in Mongolia, what it was like for her to write about that experience, and what the response has been.","enclosure":{"@attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/downloads.newyorker.com\/mp3\/outloud\/140210_outloud_levy.mp3","length":"6892721","type":"audio\/mpeg"}},"pubDate":"Tue, 04 Feb 2014 22:57:35 GMT","guid":"http:\/\/downloads.newyorker.com\/mp3\/outloud\/140210_outloud_levy.mp3"},{"title":"Peter Schjeldahl on William Burroughs","link":"http:\/\/downloads.newyorker.com\/mp3\/outloud\/140203_outloud_schjeldahl.mp3","description":"Peter Schjeldahl is the magazine's art critic, but this week he takes on a literary subject: William S. Burroughs. A new biography of Burroughs was recently published, and next month is the centenary of his birth. Schjeldahl writes that Burroughs is always being rediscovered by \"properly disaffected young readers,\" and, on the podcast, he tells the editor Sasha Weiss that \"reading Burroughs is a sort of rite of passage, which is most effective in your late teens, early twenties, but you can do a remedial one later on.\" For Schjeldahl, who was an aspiring poet in New York, in the nineteen-sixties, Burroughs and his \"cut-up\" writing style were an important influence. Here, Schjeldahl and Weiss listen to archival recordings of Burroughs reading from his first novel, \"Junky,\" and discuss the transformative effect that Burroughs and the Beats had on American literature.","enclosure":{"@attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/downloads.newyorker.com\/mp3\/outloud\/140203_outloud_schjeldahl.mp3","length":"6892721","type":"audio\/mpeg"}},"pubDate":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:22:33 GMT","guid":"http:\/\/downloads.newyorker.com\/mp3\/outloud\/140203_outloud_schjeldahl.mp3"},{"title":"Rebecca Mead and Daniel Zalewski on gender and literature.","link":"http:\/\/downloads.newyorker.com\/mp3\/outloud\/140120_outloud_mead.mp3","description":"In the January 13th issue, Rebecca Mead profiles the hugely successful and popular fiction writer Jennifer Weiner, whose books have sold more than four and a half million copies.

According to many scientists, we are now in the midst of the sixth great extinction, a massive die-off of species around the globe. In recent issues, The New Yorker has published pieces by Kolbert on species extinction, from chapters in her forthcoming book, \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History.\" Here, she talks to Sasha Weiss about the enormity of the problem.

He argues that we should legalize performance-enhancing drugs and then regulate them, and imagines a world where athletes make their biological passports public: \"What I really would like is to have complete liberalization and complete transparency. I would like to know about every single baseball player, track-and-field athlete, basketball player, precisely what they are on.
